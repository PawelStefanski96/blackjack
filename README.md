# blackjack
My first bigger project to recreate simple blackjack game. 

## Rules of the game:
#### The deck is unlimited in size. 
#### There are no jokers. 
#### The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
#### The the Ace counts as 11
#### The cards in the deck have equal probability of being drawn.
#### Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
#### There is no specific color of cards just types

## Scoring rules:
#### You draw a cards at first you get 2 cards from deck
#### If your score is higher than 21 you lose, if dealer score higher than 21 while you score 21 or lower you win.
#### If your score is lower or equal to 21 and your score is the same as dealer's score it's always a draw.
#### If you score a 21 and dealer dont have 21 either you win by blackjack
#### If you have higher score than dealer and your score is lower or equal to 21 you won
#### If dealer have higher score than you and dealer's score is lower or equal to 21 you lost.
